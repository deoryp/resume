## Internships 2000 - 2006

I was able to participate in 7 internships during my high school and college years. I learned a lot of valuable lessons from these that I carry with me even 10+ years later. These experiences showed me the value of mentorship and I continue to both look for opportunities to be mentored and find ways to help mentor others.
