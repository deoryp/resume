## Summary

UPDATE THIS: I am interested in working on a broad array of technologies. I like working on
everything from embedded microcontrollers to websites. The best job blends all the things and
creates a fusion of the trades. I am interested in working abroad. I have become increasing good
at migrating legacy monolithic systems in API driven micro-services, but that is not all I can
do. I am full stack, but my strength is not pixel perfect replication of UI.

*Specialties*: Java, Spring, Hibernate, JavaScript (polymer, backbone, marionette, grunt, gulp), node.js
*Past-times*: iPhone Development in Objective-C, embedded development in C, woodworking

features.
