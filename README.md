## Experience

### Software Engineer at Google
**September 2015 - Present** (1 year 10 months+)

Working as part of Chrome Remote Desktop (CRD) on a new iOS client. Migrated and rewrote the CRD
iOS app to be housed inside of the Chromium repo. This provides visibility to the project and
it's integration needs with other fast moving dependencies inside of Chromium. Rewrote core
libraries used by CRD clients to be architecture agnostic with a small integration layer used
on the native side.

Active in Google 20% Time where I was able to learn new things from outside the team and bring
them back for use on the main project and vice versa. Was an Intern Host for summer 2017.


### Sr Software Engineer at Riot Games
**March 2012 - August 2015** (3 years 6 months)

Joined Riot as a Java Backend Engineer tasked to develop in the integration layer between the
in-client store and the main platform. Later transitioned into Store Tech Lead for the Store
Team. This role had been helping decide what technology choices we as a team move forward with
in an effort to separate and rewrite a php monolithic project into a micro-service supported
client side rendered application. This also provided Riot with an internal Store API to migrate
away from using SQL scripts to RESTful API calls for things like season rewards and more. We
have to do this in flight, using various techniques (proxies, shims and more) that allow us to
deprecate the old and integrate the new in manageable releasable pieces. This has happened
alongside releasing new features. My personal mission in this work was to deliver technical
credit: build solutions that solved our current problem but also other teams problems at the
same time. Along the way trying to level peers up, change the culture of the team to be open to
ideation with an open mind.


### Sr. Software Engineer at Cedexis
**March 2011 - January 2012** (11 months)

Developed new features for the client portal for Cedexis main product, the CDN load-balancer.
Used agile development on a 2 week release cycle. Team used jira to track issues, development
was ticket based. Worked mostly in Java / Spring / Hibernate environment. Worked on the
fullstack, from writing jsp pages from html reference designs to implementing jQuery
extensions, RESTful web controllers, creating RESTful web APIs, extending domain model objects
and persisting them in the postgres database. Used Spring MVC-based design for frontend. Used
multi-tiered service layer for the backend. Project source control was git.


### Software Engineer (Contract) at Applied Minds
**January 2009 - March 2011** (2 years 3 months)

Applied Minds is a company who solves problems for other companies. Sometimes this takes the
form of a short term ideation and prototyping, so the work is varied and interesting. My
involved projects ranged from kids toys, satellites, phone interaction experiments, file
management software, and the occasional robot. Worked with AVR32 and LPC2468 ARM7
microcontrollers performing various sensor and interface integration; Java; Javascript; iOS;
(Terse for NDA reasons; VidMe was part/during this contract)


### Java/Spring Software Engineer at Cedexis
**February 2010 - April 2010** (3 months)

Part time work, helped perform a major refactor of an inherited Java web application.
Implemented correct multi-tiered hierarchy. Upgraded from Spring 2.5 to 3.0. Main responsibility
was to develop an OAuth enabled JSON based web API.


### Software Engineer at VidMe, Inc.
**January 2009 - November 2010** (1 year, 10 months)

VidMe was a startup with the idea to share video in the most private way possible. Created a
website to upload and share video with anyone using only an email address.

Acted first as junior engineer and then as lead engineer for VidMe. Developed new features for
the service as well as an administrative application to manage and view the state of the
service. Helped manage a small team overseas, and reviewed the code produced. Developed an
iPhone app for uploading videos easily from an iPhone that was released into the AppStore and
later developed a full site-replicating app that was not released.

Deployed new versions of the web application hosted on EC2. This included Wowza configuration,
managed puppet config, managed SVN branchings and merges, and on-going deployment on the staging
servers.


### Software Engineer at ViaLogy

scripted automatic test framework to be used in the production line.


### Firmware Engineer at Tripod Data Systems (A Trimble Company)
**January 2007 - January 2008** (1 year 1 month),

Worked in a small firmware design team to integrate Marvell-based hardware platform into a
Windows Mobile 6 ready PDA device. Responsibilities included debugging software defects,
writing/modifying OEM drivers (OEM information, battery, and video drivers), writing test
applications to aid in verifying hardware/software functionality, and development on a system
