**Software Engineer at Google**

## Summary

UPDATE THIS: I am interested in working on a broad array of technologies. I like working on
everything from embedded microcontrollers to websites. The best job blends all the things and
creates a fusion of the trades. I am interested in working abroad. I have become increasing good
at migrating legacy monolithic systems in API driven micro-services, but that is not all I can
do. I am full stack, but my strength is not pixel perfect replication of UI.

*Specialties*: Java, Spring, Hibernate, JavaScript (polymer, backbone, marionette, grunt, gulp), node.js

*Past-times*: iPhone Development in Objective-C, embedded development in C, woodworking

## Experience

### Software Engineer at Google
**September 2015 - Present** (1 year 10 months)

### Sr Software Engineer at Riot Games
**March 2012 - August 2015** (3 years 6 months)

Joined Riot as a Java Backend Engineer tasked to develop in the integration layer between the
monetization store and the inventory / game loop platform. Have since been transitioned into
Store Tech Lead for the Store Team. My new role has been helping decide what technology choices
we as a team move forward with in an effort to separate and rewrite a php monolithic project
into a micro-service supported client side rendered application. This also provided Riot with
an internal Store API to migrate away from using SQL scripts to RESTful API calls for things
like season rewards and more. We have to do this in flight, using various techniques (proxies,
shims and more) that allow us to deprecate the old and integrate the new in manageable
releasable pieces. This has happened alongside releasing new features. My personal mission in
this work was to deliver technical credit: build solutions that solved our current problem but
also other teams problems at the same time.


### Sr. Software Engineer at Cedexis
**March 2011 - January 2012** (11 months)

Developed new features for the client portal for Cedexis main product, the CDN load-balancer.
Used agile development on a 2 week release cycle. Team used jira to track issues, development
was ticket based. Worked mostly in Java / Spring / Hibernate environment. Worked on the
fullstack, from writing jsp pages from html reference designs to implementing jQuery
extensions, RESTful web controllers, creating RESTful web APIs, extending domain model objects
and persisting them in the postgres database. Used Spring MVC-based design for frontend. Used
multi-tiered service layer for the backend. Project source control was git.


### Software Engineer (Contract) at Applied Minds
**January 2009 - March 2011** (2 years 3 months)

Applied Minds is a company who solves problems for other companies. Sometimes this takes the
form of a short term ideation and prototyping, so the work is varied and interesting. My
involved projects ranged from kids toys, satellites, phone interaction experiments, file
management software, and the occasional robot. Worked with AVR32 and LPC2468 ARM7
microcontrollers performing various sensor and interface integration; Java; Javascript; iOS;
(Terse for NDA reasons; VidMe was part/during this contract)
